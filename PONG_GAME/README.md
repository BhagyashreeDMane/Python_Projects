# PONG GAME
Welcome to the Pong Game project! This is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle and score points by making the ball go past your opponent's paddle.

## Game Rules

* There are two paddles available: one for the right player and one for the left player.
* The players can move their paddles up and down to hit the ball using the following controls:
  - Right Player Controls: Up Arrow (Move Up), Down Arrow (Move Down)
  - Left Player Controls: 'w' key (Move Up), 's' key (Move Down)
* The ball will bounce off the paddles and the walls, changing its direction accordingly.
* If the ball goes past your opponent's paddle, you score a point.
* The game will continue until one player reaches the maximum score limit (decided by you) or you choose to quit the game.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Turtle: The Pong Game utilizes the turtle module for creating the game graphics
